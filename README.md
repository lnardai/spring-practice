## Motivation

I want ot create some reference project on divided by key spring components 
and try to experiment with new technologies and ways to create better code.

##Structure

Each subdirectory will contain a different kind of project. Usually there will be an App.class which can run SpringBoot, but the App in it self is 
just to verify that it can start up, probably no useful functionality will be implemented. It's better to understand the functionality through tests.

## Installation

Use the provided gradle configurations. Most functionality can be verified by running the test suits.
I plan to create different suits of test for different levels of test. Unit and Integration.

## Tests

`gradle clean test`
